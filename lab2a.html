<h1 id="C1">Chapter 1 : CSS Tutorials</h1>
<p>CSS is the acronym for "Cascading Style Sheet". This tutorial covers both the versions CSS1,CSS2 and CSS3, and gives a complete understanding of CSS, starting from its basics to advanced concepts.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="C1.1">1.1 CSS Tutorial</h3>
<p>A Cascading Style Sheet, commonly known as CSS, is the layer of styling over HTML elements, or in simpler terms, it lets you style the elements (font, size, color, and spacing) of your HTML pages and content by gently applying classes to it. CSS takes care of the presentation and helps you determine how the pages and content that you make with HTML are going to look and display. CSS will be a savior once you have learned to master the code. To master CSS, you first need to understand the different types of CSS. There are basically three ways of writing CSS, which are mentioned below.</p>

<h3 id="C1.2">1.2 CSS2 Tutorial</h3>
<P>CSS2 selectors and properties allow authors to refer to the following "entities" from within a style sheet:</P>
<ul>
    <li>Elements in the document tree and certain relationships between them.</li>
    <li>Attributes of elements in the document tree, and values of those attributes.</li>
    <li>Some parts of element content (see the :first-line and :first-letter pseudo-elements.</li>
    <li>Elements of the document tree when they are in a certain state.</li>
    <li>Some aspects of the canvas where the document will be rendered.</li>
    <li>Some system information</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="C1.3">1.3 CSS3 Tutorial</h3>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets Level 3 (CSS3) is the iteration of the CSS standard used in the styling and formatting of Web pages. CSS3 incorporates the CSS2 standard with some changes and improvements.</p>
<p>CSS3 makes changes to how some visual elements are implemented and rendered by a browser. However, it is not a single hugely unwieldy specification, unlike CSS2. CSS3 is separated into separate modules to facilitate development. This means that the specification comes out in chunks, with more stable modules than others.</p>

<h1 id="C2">Chapter 2 : Scripting Tutorial</h1>
<p>All scripting languages are programming languages. The scripting language is basically a language where instructions are written for a run time environment. They do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted. It brings new functions to applications and glue complex system together. A scripting language is a programming language designed for integrating and communicating with other programming languages.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="C2.1">2.1 VB Script</h3>
<P>VBScript is an Active Scripting language developed by Microsoft that is modeled on Visual Basic. It allows Microsoft Windows system administrators to generate powerful tools for managing computers with error handling, subroutines, and other advanced programming constructs. It can give the user complete control over many aspects of their computing environment.</P>

<h3 id="C2.2">2.2 Bash</h3>
<p>It is a scripting language to work in the Linux interface. It is a lot easier to use bash to create scripts than other programming languages. It describes the tools to use and code in the command line and create useful reusable scripts and conserve documentation for other people to work with.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="C2.3">2.3 Python</h3>
<p>It is easy, free and open source. It supports procedure-oriented programming and object-oriented programming. Python is an interpreted language with dynamic semantics and huge lines of code are scripted and is currently the most hyped language among developers.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="C2.4">2.4 Node js</h3>
<p>It is a framework to write network applications using JavaScript. Corporate users of Node.js include IBM, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, Yahoo for real-time web applications.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="C2.5">2.5 Perl</h3>
<p> A scripting language with innovative features to make it different and popular. Found on all windows and Linux servers. It helps in text manipulation tasks. High traffic websites that use Perl extensively include priceline.com, IMDB.</p>
